# GoogleMapStreetViewSideBySide
Viewing google map and street view side by side 

You can see a script is added at the below 

  <script async defer
        src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initialize">
  </script>

Make sure you replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your own , I have used mine  , which is : AIzaSyAQdM3z7DNRkf0nenLAWU9_9SmFUb8KTTM

To get your api key  visit : https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
